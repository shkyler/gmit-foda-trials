# GMIT FODA TRIALS
As I work through the FODA module, I will store any weekly excercises here.

## Week 1
On week one we covered jupyter notebooks and the start of the "Monty Hall" problem. To expand on what was covered in the lectures I created a Jupyter note book and linked it to the iris analyser program that I created last year as part of the Programming and Scripting module("Iris Analyser.ipynb"). This works great with the graphic returning nicely in the browser window. All files pertaining to this are in the "Week 01" folder.


## Week 2
In week 2 we covered analysis of a data set Ian put together from out submissions. Then we looked at the Monty Hall problem in general. There was no additonal work required this week. However I wrote a python script called monty.py this is a version of the Monty Hall game. I also created montysim.py to run the simulation 10,000 each for 'Staying' or 'Switching' and plotting the results. Finally I created a Jupyter Notebook to run the simulation and display the results ("Monty Hall Simulation.ipynb")

## Week 3
In week 3 we covered the lady tasting tea problem. It introduced us to the concept of hypotheses testing. I created a Jupyter notebook like ians to demonstrate the concept. I made some changes to the python to make it easier to read the code

## Week 4
In week 4 we covered drug testing and Bayes' Theorm, I created a notebook to work through the examples

## Week 5 
In week 4 I watched the linear regression videos. I then worked though the examples applying them to the data I plotted for Week 3 in PFDA. I also read down through the advance section
