# GMIT FODA TRIALS
As I work through the FODA module, I will store any weekly excercises here.

## Week 1
On week one we covered jupyter notebooks and the start of the "Monty Hall" problem. To expand on what was covered in the lectures I created a Jupyter note book and linked it to the iris analyser program that I created last year as part of the Programming and Scripting module("Iris Analyser.ipynb"). This works great with the graphic returning nicely in the browser window. All files pertaining to this are in the "Week 01" folder.


## Week 2
test on MacOS update
