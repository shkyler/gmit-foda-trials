# GMIT FODA TRIALS
As I work through the FODA module, I will store any weekly excercises here.

## Week 1
On week one we covered juppyter notebooks and the start of the "Monty Hall" problem. To expand on what was covered in the lectures I created a Jupyter note book and linked it to the iris analyser program that I created last year as part of the Programming and Scripting module. This works great with the graphic returning nicely in the browser window
